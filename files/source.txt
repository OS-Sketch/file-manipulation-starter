Welcome to Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (now version 1.00 --
see book news for details), a free online operating systems book! The
book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental
to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In
understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical,
including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU,
manage memory, and store files persistently. Lots of fun stuff! Or
maybe not so fun?
